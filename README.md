# [BowlTastic](https://bowltastic.herokuapp.com/)

## A full-stack employee managment suite aimed towards small businesses.
*-Wait, if it's an "employee management" app, why is it called "Bowltastic"?*

We used a fictional bowling alley as user story to demonstrate the app, but the core concept is that the app could be spun out to any small business that needs basic employee managment functionality: things like employee timeclock tracking, time-off requests, shifts and hours worked, employee roles, and even automated payroll. If another business wanted to use the app, we could deploy it to them nothing more than a small bit of restyling to match their branding.
